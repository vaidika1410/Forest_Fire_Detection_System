# 🔥 Forest Fire Detection using CNN

This project is a part of the **AIML Internship Week 1 Assessment** provided by **Edunet Foundation**.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project aims to detect forest fires from images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. It follows a structured pipeline involving data collection, image preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation.

---

## 🧩 Project Pipeline

1. **Data Collection & Loading**
   - Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
   - Environment: Google Colab
   - Dataset Split: Training, Validation, Testing

2. **Image Processing & Augmentation**
   - Resize and normalize images
   - Apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.)

3. **CNN Model Building**
   - Convolutional + Pooling Layers
   - Flatten + Dense Layers
   - Trained using binary crossentropy and Adam optimizer

4. **Testing & Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Tool: Confusion Matrix for visualization
